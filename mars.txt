This is a thesis on planets
Earth's neighbour. Smaller than earth. 2 moons. CO2 rich atmosphere.
Spirit and Opportunity have been on the planet for 10 years.
The day is a SOL.
The big search for water on the surface has been disappointing.
It would take a year to travel to Mars.
You can buy a 1 way ticket to mars in the Netherlands.
There are nice landslides on mars, though, and seeps of liquid
in some of the polar landscapes, probably salty brines
In addition, both spirit and opportunity have found 
evidence of sedimentary deposits with clays indicating 
previous watery environments in the past.
